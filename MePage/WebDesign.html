  <p class="classassign">I really loved this class, it taught me so many things about CSS and HTML. The site that this is in is the project I have been working on for this semester. I had a ton of fun experimenting with HTML, which you can see if you go to "a cool spot in the site." I had a little bit of difficulties figuring everything out at first, but I have worked through it and solved the problems.

    My favorite resource for this class is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">W3 schools</a> because it gave me a lot of help in this class.
